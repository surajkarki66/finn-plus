**FINN+** is a fork of **FINN**, an experimental framework from the Integrated Communications and AI Lab of AMD Research & Advanced Development to explore deep neural network inference on FPGAs.
It specifically targets quantized neural networks, with emphasis on generating dataflow-style architectures customized for each network.
The resulting FPGA accelerators are highly efficient and can yield high throughput and low latency.
The framework is fully open-source in order to give a higher degree of flexibility, and is intended to enable neural network research spanning several layers of the software/hardware abstraction stack.

## What's New in FINN+

FINN+ incorporates all upstream FINN development while adding significant enhancements across multiple areas:

### Core Improvements

- **Transformer/Attention Support** - Native support for modern transformer architectures
- **Enhanced Streamlining** - Improved optimization pipeline for better performance
- **Smart FIFO Sizing (WIP)** - Automatic folding and FIFO-sizing with better algorithms
- **QoR Estimation (WIP)** - Empirical quality-of-result estimation for design space exploration

### Backend Extensions

- **Hardware Profiling** - Instrumentation for accurate performance measurement in simulation and hardware
- **Alveo Support** - Enhanced build flow for Xilinx Alveo cards
- **Multi-FPGA** - Support for distributed inference across multiple FPGAs
- **Optimized Drivers** - High-performance C++ drivers for better host-accelerator communication

### Developer Experience

- **Better Diagnostics** - Improved logging and error handling throughout the framework
- **Type Safety** - Comprehensive type hinting and checking for better code quality
- **YAML Configuration** - Alternative YAML-based build configuration system
- **Simplified Setup** - Containerless installation and setup process

**Track Development**: Check our [Feature Tracker](https://github.com/orgs/eki-project/projects/1) for real-time status updates on all features. We merge improvements early to accelerate development and enable cutting-edge research.

## Getting Started

This is a quick overview of how to get started, for additional information please refer to our [**Wiki**](https://github.com/eki-project/finn-plus/wiki)!

### Prerequisites

Before installing FINN+, ensure you have:

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or 3.11 (Python 3.12+ not yet supported)
- **Xilinx Tools**: Vivado, Vitis, and Vitis HLS (2022.2 or 2024.2)
- **System Dependencies**: See our [dependency installation script](installDependencies.sh) for required packages

### Installing via pip

After preparing the dependencies mentioned above, simply run the following to start a build flow:

```
# Make sure to create a fresh virtual environment for FINN+
pip install finn-plus                     # Install FINN+ and its Python dependencies via pip
finn deps update                          # Ensure FINN+ pulled all further dependencies (this might update packages in your venv!)
finn build build_config.yaml model.onnx   # Run a FINN+ build defined in a YAML file
```

For more detailed instructions, like installation for development use, please refer to our [**Wiki**](https://github.com/eki-project/finn-plus/wiki)!

> [!NOTE]
> Please note, that `finn deps update` (and most other commands) will automatically download and update dependencies required for FINN to work (mostly the same as the original FINN repository).
> This is done to provide a better user experience and to not require the user to manage a dozen dependencies on their own.
> If you want to know which dependencies will be installed before continuing, check out `external_dependencies.yaml`.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! Whether you are fixing a bug, adding a new feature, improving documentation, or sharing a model — every contribution helps.

To get started:

1. **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. **Check** the [Feature Tracker](https://github.com/orgs/eki-project/projects/1) to see what is planned or already in progress.
3. **Open an issue** to discuss larger changes before investing significant effort.
4. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your changes.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines on code style, testing, and the review process.
